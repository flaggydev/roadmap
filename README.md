## About Flaggy

Flaggy is designed to make feature flagging simple and accessible for small teams and individual developers. Our goal is to help you roll out new features safely and control the release process with ease.

## Public Roadmap

We believe in transparency and building in public. Our public roadmap is hosted on GitHub Projects, where you can see what we're currently working on, what's planned for the future, and track our progress.
